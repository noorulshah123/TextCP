Option A — awslogs → CloudWatch (no sidecar)

We will use the ECS awslogs driver to ship only application stdout/stderr to CloudWatch. Log groups are organized by team/env/cluster using ShinyProxy’s cloud-watch-group-prefix, producing paths like /ecs/<team>/<env>/<cluster>/sp-<appId>, and streams are prefixed via cloud-watch-stream-prefix (e.g., <cluster>/sp-container-<id>). This is the simplest, lowest-overhead setup and is recommended when we don’t need multiline merging or enrichment.

Option B — Fluent Bit (inside the app container) → CloudWatch

We will bundle Fluent Bit in the app image and start it from the entrypoint to tail app logs and ship them to CloudWatch. Log groups follow the same /ecs/<team>/<env>/<cluster>/sp-<appId> convention, while streams are consistently prefixed (e.g., container-…). This provides structured/multiline application logs and optional field enrichment (team/env/cluster/app/user) without adding ECS sidecars.

What these ShinyProxy ECS settings do
proxy:
  ecs:
    cloud-watch-group-prefix: /ecs/${TEAM_NAME}/${ENV}/${CLUSTER_NAME}/
    cloud-watch-stream-prefix: ${CLUSTER_NAME}


cloud-watch-group-prefix: the path prefix for the CloudWatch log group. ShinyProxy appends sp-<appId> to this, so your groups look like:

/ecs/<team>/<env>/<cluster>/sp-<appId>


cloud-watch-stream-prefix: the prefix for log streams created by ECS for each container instance of the app. You’ll see stream names like:

<cluster>/sp-container-<containerId>-0


This gives you cluster/team scoping at the group level and recognizable container lineage at the stream level.

How Fluent Bit also produces organized groups/streams

In your Fluent Bit output config (run from the app’s entrypoint), set the same values explicitly—ideally with environment variables:

[OUTPUT]
    Name                cloudwatch_logs
    Match               app.*
    region              ${AWS_REGION}
    log_group_name      /ecs/${TEAM_NAME}/${ENV}/${CLUSTER_NAME}/sp-${APP_NAME}
    log_stream_prefix   container-
    auto_create_group   true
    log_format          json


log_group_name matches the ShinyProxy convention exactly (so permissions & dashboards are consistent).

log_stream_prefix gives tidy, consistent stream names (e.g., container-0001…).

If you add a record filter, Fluent Bit can enrich each event (optional):

[FILTER]
    Name    record_modifier
    Match   app.*
    Record  team     ${TEAM_NAME}
    Record  env      ${ENV}
    Record  cluster  ${CLUSTER_NAME}
    Record  app      ${APP_NAME}

Example outputs

awslogs event (plain line):

INFO 2025-08-31T10:23:04Z user=alice GET /health 200 3ms


Group: /ecs/globaltech/dev/apps-globaltech-dev/sp-streamlit-app
Stream: apps-globaltech-dev/sp-container-8cb922cf...-0

Fluent Bit event (structured JSON + same organization):

{
  "ts": "2025-08-31T10:23:04.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "msg": "GET /health 200 3ms",
  "team": "globaltech",
  "env": "dev",
  "cluster": "apps-globaltech-dev",
  "app": "sp-streamlit-app"
}


Group: /ecs/globaltech/dev/apps-globaltech-dev/sp-streamlit-app
Stream: container-0001…

Quick chooser

Want only application logs, minimal moving parts → awslogs.

Want multiline merging / structured fields / optional enrichment (still only application logs) → Fluent Bit in entrypoint, with the log_group_name/log_stream_prefix set as above.

awslogs → CloudWatch (simple): Use the ECS awslogs driver to ship only your app’s stdout/stderr. With ShinyProxy set to cloud-watch-group-prefix: /ecs/<team>/<env>/<cluster>/ and cloud-watch-stream-prefix: <cluster>, logs land under /ecs/<team>/<env>/<cluster>/sp-<appId> with streams like <cluster>/sp-container-<id>. Lowest overhead; great when you don’t need multiline merging or enrichment.

Fluent Bit → CloudWatch (richer): Start Fluent Bit in your app entrypoint to tail app logs and push to the same group path (/ecs/<team>/<env>/<cluster>/sp-<appId>) with a tidy log_stream_prefix (e.g., container-). You still get only application logs, plus nicer features (merged stack traces, optional JSON fields like team/env/cluster/app/user).

What the ShinyProxy knobs do: cloud-watch-group-prefix prepends the log group path; ShinyProxy then adds sp-<appId>. cloud-watch-stream-prefix sets the prefix of each container’s log stream so you can instantly see which cluster it came from.
